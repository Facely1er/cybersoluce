For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Emphasize regional adaptability - Make sure of creating components that can adapt to different regions while maintaining a consistent core
Request internationalization from the start - Build in language support and regional adaptations from the foundation, rather than adding them later
Focus on data privacy compliance - Highlight the need for proper data handling across borders with appropriate privacy controls
Consider regional differences in regulations - Ask for specific adaptations for major regulatory frameworks like GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), PIPL (China), etc.
Include cultural considerations - Request that interfaces and content be culturally neutral or adaptable to avoid issues in global deployment
Prioritize global infrastructure - Ensure the architecture supports distributed deployment with appropriate data sovereignty controls
