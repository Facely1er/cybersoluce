# NIST CSF v2 Integration Notes

- NIST CSF v2 catalog imported from NIST-Implementator.

- Catalog currently not wired into governanceStore.

- Next steps:

  1. Map CSF → CyberSoluce Framework type.

  2. Inject into governanceStore.

  3. Generate CSF-driven assessments.

  4. Extend dashboards to show CSF maturity.

  5. Add cross-framework mapping (future when pulling ERMITS-AUDITOR).
